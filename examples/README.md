# Asteracea Examples

Individual stand-alone examples for using [Asteracea](../README.md).

These are separated out into their own crates to make dependency management more organised.

## Contributing

When adding an example, make sure to also add it to <../.github/dependabot.yml>.

Create a fairly minimal example, without unnecessary flourishes, except to illustrate specific use cases. (Comment with motivation!)

Create a `README.md` in the example's directory with (if applicable) screenshots, `## Running` and `## Output`. If the output can vary, use `## Sample Output` instead.

## List of Examples

### [Tracing Sample](tracing-sample#tracing-sample)

Shows how to log GUI calls to the console or a file, and how to render flamegraphs and flamecharts.
