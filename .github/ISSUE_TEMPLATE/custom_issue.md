<!--
Please make sure to include all necessary information directly in the issue text.
If I have to go to external resources to understand it, I'm much less likely to process the issue.

For pull requests and bug reports, see the appropriate issue templates for more information about how best to report them.

For vulnerability reports: Please practice responsible disclosure and try to contact me privately first.
