Thank you for your contribution to the `TODO_CRATE_NAME` repository!

Before submitting this pull request, please make sure:

* [ ] You've read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

* [ ] The `version` value in `Cargo.toml` is unchanged.

* [ ] Your code builds cleanly without any errors or warnings and passes all tests.

* [ ] You have added documentation with examples and integration tests (in the `tests/` folder) where applicable.

* [ ] You have added yourself to `authors` in `Cargo.toml` if applicable and to the copyright holders lists in `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`, or amended the copyright years in the `LICENSE-*` files if you had contributed in a previous year.  
  * Using a nickname and/or leaving out your email address is fine too.
  * If you instead do not wish to be credited, please remark this in your pull request.

Once this all is taken care of, please erase this default text and briefly describe your changes.  
If your pull request adds or changes features (outside of documentation), please also add the motivation for these changes or link the matching issue.

**Drafts welcome!** If you're unsure whether a feature is in scope or how to implement it, feel to post incomplete work here.
I'll try to get back to you quickly, but depending on how busy I am, I might need up to a week for the initial response.
