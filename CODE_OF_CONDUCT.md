# Code of Conduct

This repository follows [the same code of conduct as the Rust project](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).  
However, since this project isn't directly part of the latter, you should contact me at [tamme@schichler.dev](mailto:tamme@schichler.dev) (email or XMPP) in case there's an issue in this regard.
