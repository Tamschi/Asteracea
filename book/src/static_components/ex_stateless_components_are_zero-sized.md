Consider the following (grasping at [constructor parameter]()[ captures]() and [value formatting]() a bit ahead of time):

```rust asteracea=Container
use std::{fmt::Debug, mem::size_of};

asteracea::component! {
  MySize<T: Debug>(
    priv value: T,
  )()

  [
    !"I contain {:?}!"(self.value)
    " My size is " <b !(size_of::<Self>())> " bytes."
    !" I'm located at address {:p}."(self)
  ]
}

asteracea::component! {
  Container()()

  [
    <*MySize::<()> *value = {()}> "\n"
    <*MySize::<()> *value = {()}> "\n"
    <*MySize::<u8> *value = {1}> "\n"
    <*MySize::<usize> *value = {2}> "\n"
    "The container instance occupies " <b !(size_of::<Self>())> !" bytes at {:p}."(self)
  ]
}
```

The layout here is somewhat implementation-defined, but generally what you should see is that the `MySize::<()>` instances take up no space inside the `Container` instance and don't displace other children in memory.

This is because Asteracea components contain no hidden instance state, which means they are sized to content (and padding requirements), all the way down to zero. `()` is Rust's [unit](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.unit.html) type, the most convenient [zero sized type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts). The same applies to components without instance fields, of course.

Zero-sizing is transitive and has many interesting implications, but for our purposes the most notable one is that stateless components are *almost*ยน function-like at runtime. It's for this reason that Asteracea doesn't provide a special "slim" component syntax.
