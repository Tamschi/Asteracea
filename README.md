TODO: Rewrite the following points into a nice README.

- Co-location! You don't have to hunt down logic elsewhere, it's ideally consilely in one place.
- Unspecific errors (i.e. ones that happen on internal tokens and colour the entire macro invocation) are always bugs!
  - Seriously, please report them, ideally with a reproducible sample. I'll fix them to be much more specific if I can reproduce them.
